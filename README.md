### Foreward
MapleBot was built, tested, and run on an 8 year old laptop with a screen that is 1280 x 800 (resolution shouldn't make a difference) on a T4200 Pentium Dual Core 2.00GHz with 3Gb ram Windows 7 64bit. If I can run it on that, you can run it.

Supports the new required Nexon Launcher. While the bot is running, you cannot touch or use your computer. Because of pixel detections, Windows 7 may be required unless modifications are made to the code (any other OSes have not been tested). 

Kanna_Flat_MapleBot.au3 is for training at Northwest Heights. Xenon_Arcane_MapleBot.au3 is for training at Hidden Torrent Zone. When building your own MapleBot.au3 code, use Xenon_Arcane_MapleBot.au3 as your reference-- it contains the most up-to-date code.

# Setup and Instructions

Unzip the package into your Documents folder

Your computer must have a single login (or no logins) and no password.

All screenshots are stored in Screenshots. Do not delete this folder.

Set your Nexon Launcher to run when your computer starts. Open up Nexon Launcher, click the dropdown menu in the top right, click Settings, and check the box as shown below:

Change your PIC to any combination of 1s and 7s. Your PIC can only contains 1s and 7s.

Expand your Mini Map to its largest size.

Kanna_Flat_MapleBot.au3 just assumes your last selected character was your Kanna. Xenon_Arcane_MapleBot.au3 assumes your Xenon is on the top-leftmost slot on the first character selection screen as shown below (these are configurable):

Your antivirus may affect sending email. You may need to disable your antivirus, or reconfigure it to permit emails/SMTP (as is the case with Avast).
